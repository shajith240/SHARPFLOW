-- CREATE MISSING SETUP TASKS FOR SHAJITH4434@GMAIL.COM
-- This user has no setup tasks, which causes the completion message to show
-- =====================================================

-- Step 1: Get user information
SELECT

    id,

    subscription_status,

WHERE email = 'shajith4434@gmail.com';

-- Step 2: Check current setup tasks (should be empty)
SELECT

    COUNT(*) as task_count
FROM customer_setup_tasks 
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'shajith4434@gmail.com');

-- Step 3: Create the missing setup tasks with explicit IDs
-- First, get the next available ID values

-- Step 4: Verify the setup tasks were created

    status,
    COUNT(*) as task_count
FROM customer_setup_tasks 
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'shajith4434@gmail.com')

-- Step 6: Verify owner notification exists
SELECT

    id,
    notification_type,

    created_at
FROM owner_notifications 
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'shajith4434@gmail.com');

-- EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER RUNNING THIS SCRIPT
-- =====================================================

/*
EXPECTED RESULTS:

1. Setup Tasks: 3 records created (falcon, sage, sentinel)
2. All tasks have status = 'pending'
3. All tasks have empty api_keys_configured = '{}'
4. Owner notification should exist with status = 'pending_setup'

This should result in the owner dashboard showing:
- Individual API key input forms for each agent
- All agents showing "pending" status  
- No "All API Keys Configured!" completion message
- Manual configuration workflow ready for testing

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run this SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Refresh the owner dashboard in browser
3. Navigate to Pending Setups â†’ shajith4434@gmail.com
4. Should see 3 individual agent setup forms with pending status
5. Manually enter API keys for each agent
6. Verify status changes from pending to completed
