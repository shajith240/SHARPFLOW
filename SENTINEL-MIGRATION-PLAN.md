# Sentinel Agent Migration Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating the Sentinel agent functionality from the existing n8n workflow to native SharpFlow web application code, ensuring exact functional parity while replacing Telegram-based interactions with SharpFlow's native web interface.

## Analysis Summary

### Current n8n Workflow Components
1. **Email Monitoring**: Polls Gmail every minute for new emails
2. **Email Classification**: Uses OpenAI to determine if emails are sales-related
3. **Thread Processing**: Reformats email threads and extracts context
4. **Dual Processing Paths**:
   - Calendar Agent: Handles meeting booking requests
   - Email Agent: Handles general sales inquiries
5. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Telegram-based approval system
6. **Response Generation**: AI-powered email responses with revision capabilities
7. **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar booking functionality
8. **Vector Store**: RAG system for company information

- [ ] Create calendar booking management interface

#### 5.2 Chat Interface Enhancement
- [ ] Add Sentinel-specific chat commands
- [ ] Implement email monitoring status display
- [ ] Create quick action buttons for common tasks
- [ ] Add email response preview functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The migration includes new tables:
- `email_monitoring_config`: User-specific monitoring settings
- `email_threads`: Email conversation tracking
- `email_messages`: Individual email storage
- `email_responses`: AI-generated responses awaiting approval
- `calendar_bookings`: Calendar booking requests
- `email_escalations`: Human intervention tracking

### API Integrations Required
1. **Gmail API**: Email monitoring and response sending
2. **Google Calendar API**: Availability checking and event creation
3. **OpenAI API**: Email classification and response generation
4. **Supabase Vector Store**: Company information retrieval

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Gmail API
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_gmail_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_gmail_client_secret
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_gmail_refresh_token

# Google Calendar API
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=your_calendar_client_id
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_calendar_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_calendar_refresh_token

# Existing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Migration Benefits

### Functional Parity
- ✅ Email monitoring and classification
- ✅ Automated response generation
- ✅ Calendar booking management
- ✅ Human approval workflow
- ✅ Escalation handling

### Improvements Over n8n
1. **Native Integration**: Direct integration with SharpFlow's existing architecture
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based real-time notifications
3. **Better UX**: Web-based approval interface instead of Telegram
4. **Scalability**: Built on SharpFlow's scalable infrastructure
5. **Consistency**: Unified user experience across all AI agents

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Email processing logic
- [ ] OpenAI integration functions
- [ ] Database operations
- [ ] Calendar booking logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Gmail API integration
- [ ] Google Calendar API integration
- [ ] WebSocket communication
- [ ] End-to-end email workflow

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Email monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Response quality validation
- [ ] Approval workflow usability
- [ ] Calendar booking functionality

## Deployment Plan

### Prerequisites
1. Database migration execution
2. Gmail and Calendar API credentials setup
3. Environment variable configuration
4. Frontend component deployment

### Rollout Strategy
1. **Development Environment**: Complete implementation and testing
2. **Staging Environment**: User acceptance testing
3. **Production Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. **n8n Workflow Deactivation**: After successful validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Gmail API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
2. **Email Classification Accuracy**: Extensive testing and fine-tuning
3. **Calendar Integration Complexity**: Thorough testing of edge cases
4. **User Adoption**: Clear documentation and training

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
2. Create fallback mechanisms for API failures
3. Provide detailed user documentation
4. Maintain parallel n8n workflow during initial rollout

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Email processing accuracy > 95%
- Response generation time < 30 seconds
- System uptime > 99.9%
- API error rate < 1%

### Business Metrics
- User adoption rate > 80%
- Response approval rate > 90%
- Time to response reduction > 50%
- Customer satisfaction improvement

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete Phase 2 (Email Monitoring System)
2. **Week 1**: Implement Phase 3 (Response Generation System)
3. **Week 2**: Develop Phase 4 (HITL System)
4. **Week 3**: Create Phase 5 (Frontend Integration)
5. **Week 4**: Testing and deployment preparation

This migration will provide SharpFlow users with a powerful, integrated email automation system that maintains all the functionality of the n8n workflow while providing a superior user experience through native web integration.
