Today, that changed.\n\nAfter a nearly 20 year pursuit, we’ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.\n\nIt powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.\n\nWe believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years. \n\nThe qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller. \n\nThey are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor. \n\nImagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not! \n\nSometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.\n\nIt takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world. \n\nAnd I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft. \n\nThis is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe. \n\nIt’s not about hyping tech; it’s about building technology that truly serves the world. \n\nRead more about our discovery, and why it matters, here: https://aka.ms/AAu76rr ",

It is consistently ranked among the most valuable publicly traded companies, with a market capitalization that has at times exceeded $3 trillion. Microsoft is a leader in the information technology industry, encompassing segments such as software, cloud computing, hardware, and digital services.\n\n## Recent News and Developments\n\n**Product Lifecycle Changes**\nIn 2025, Microsoft is retiring or ending support for approximately 120 products and services, including major offerings like Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education, and IoT versions), Visual Studio App Center, Azure Database for MariaDB, and others[1][2][5]. The retirement schedule means these products will stop receiving security updates, technical support, and other services[1][5].\n\n**Product Launches and Enhancements**\nMicrosoft has announced new features in Windows Server 2025, focusing on enhancements in security, performance, and deployment flexibility[4].\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nMicrosoft is a global leader in both software and cloud computing.

Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has promoted collaboration, learning, and social responsibility, contributing to a significant cultural transformation.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nMicrosoft is publicly traded under the ticker MSFT on the NASDAQ. In its most recent fiscal year (FY24), Microsoft reported revenues exceeding $210 billion, with net income above $80 billion (figures may be slightly higher depending on late FY24/early FY25 results).

The company is known for frequent strategic partnerships and investments, particularly in AI (e.g., extended partnership with OpenAI) and cloud infrastructure.\n\n---\n\nMicrosoft continues to lead in cloud innovation, workplace productivity, and AI, while regularly evolving its product portfolio through lifecycle management and strategic acquisitions[1][2][4][5]."

breakthrough we just announced...\n\nMost of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.\n\nAfter a nearly 20 year pursuit, we’ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.\n\nIt powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.\n\nWe believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years. \n\nThe qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller. \n\nThey are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor. \n\nImagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not! \n\nSometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.\n\nIt takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world. \n\nAnd I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft. \n\nThis is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe. \n\nIt’s not about hyping tech; it’s about building technology that truly serves the world. \n\nRead more about our discovery, and why it matters, here: https://aka.ms/AAu76rr </p>\n        <p><em>Likes: 128069 | Comments: 3672</em></p>\n      </div><div class=\"linkedin-post\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n        <p>We have always been a platform- and partner-first company.

In its most recent fiscal year (FY24), Microsoft reported revenues exceeding $210 billion, with net income above $80 billion (figures may be slightly higher depending on late FY24/early FY25 results). Its main revenue streams are cloud services (Azure), Office productivity, Windows, and gaming (Xbox, Activision Blizzard).\n\n## Key Leadership Team\n\n- Satya Nadella – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n- Amy Hood – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n- Brad Smith – President and Vice Chair\n- Judson Althoff – Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\n- Scott Guthrie – Executive Vice President, Cloud + AI Group\n- Kathleen Hogan – Chief Human Resources Officer\n\n## Recent Partnerships or Acquisitions\n\n**Product and Service Retirements**\nRecent changes include the retirement of several Azure services and developer tools in 2025, indicating a shift in Microsoft's product focus and support lifecycle[5].\n\n**Acquisitions and Partnerships**\nWhile the provided search results do not detail recent acquisitions, Microsoft has historically expanded through significant acquisitions such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard. The company is known for frequent strategic partnerships and investments, particularly in AI (e.g., extended partnership with OpenAI) and cloud infrastructure.\n\n---\n\nMicrosoft continues to lead in cloud innovation, workplace productivity, and AI, while regularly evolving its product portfolio through lifecycle management and strategic acquisitions[1][2][4][5].</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      <!-- Trustpilot Reviews -->\n      <div id=\"trustpilot-reviews\">\n        <h2>Trustpilot Reviews</h2>\n        <div class=\"review-card\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\"><h3>2025-05 Cumulative Update Preview</h3><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 6/1/2025</p><p>2025-05 Cumulative Update Preview\nfor Windows 11 version 24H2 for xbased systems\n[KB5058499] install error 0x800f0983\n\nNone of the suggestions on the Microsoft support pages work.\n\nEleven years ago this was common and apparently it continues.\n\nTotally useless.</p></div><div class=\"review-card\" style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\"><h3>Word is such a sub sub sub standard…</h3><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 6/1/2025</p><p>Word is such a sub sub sub standard software.
