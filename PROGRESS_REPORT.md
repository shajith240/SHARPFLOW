- **Before:** Inline validation in components
- **After:** Reusable `validatePassword()` utility with extensible error handling

#### **CSS Variable Optimization**
- **Before:** 33 duplicate CSS variables between `:root` and `.dark` selectors
- **After:** Eliminated duplication through inheritance (dark theme inherits from root)
- **Space Saved:** ~1KB of CSS

#### **Error Handling Standardization**
- **Created:** Shared error handling utilities in `server/utils/errorHandling.ts`
- **Functions:** `handleApiError()`, `handleValidationError()`, `handleAuthError()`
- **Benefit:** Consistent error responses across all API routes

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- 📊 **Duplicate Code Eliminated:** 150+ lines
- 🔧 **Utility Functions Created:** 5 new shared utilities
