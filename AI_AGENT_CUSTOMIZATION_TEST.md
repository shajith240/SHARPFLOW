# AI Agent Customization Verification Test

## üéØ Purpose
This test confirms that AI agents are properly customized based on user information provided during the onboarding process, including both form data and document analysis.

## üîç Customization Flow Overview

### **Step 1: User Information Collection**
- **Company Profile Form**: Basic business information
- **Document Upload**: PDF documents (brochures, product docs, case studies)
- **AI Document Analysis**: Extracts business intelligence from uploaded documents

### **Step 2: Data Integration**
- **Form Data**: Company name, industry, target market, value proposition
- **Document Insights**: AI-extracted terminology, products, competitive advantages
- **Combined Profile**: Merged data creates comprehensive business context

### **Step 3: AI Agent Customization**
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Generated using both form and document data
- **Agent-Specific**: Each agent (Falcon, Sage, Sentinel, Prism) gets tailored prompts
- **Industry Context**: Incorporates specific terminology and business model

decision-making processes. Use healthcare-specific terminology like 
'clinical analytics', 'EHR integration', and 'patient outcomes' in your 
research and communications."
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Verification

### **1. Enhanced Prompt Generation Process**

The `PromptCustomizationService.buildUserPromptFromProfile()` method:

```typescript
// Extracts document insights
const documentInsights = companyProfile.aiExtractedInsights || {};
const documentTerminology = companyProfile.documentDerivedTerminology || [];
const extractedProducts = companyProfile.extractedProductsServices || [];

// Builds comprehensive prompt including:
// - Core company information
// - Document-derived customer segments  
// - Document-derived value propositions
// - Products/services from documents
// - Combined terminology (form + documents)
// - Document-derived business intelligence
```

### **2. Document Analysis Integration**

The `DocumentAnalysisService.updateCompanyProfileWithInsights()` method:

```typescript
// Merges extracted insights with existing profile
const updatedProfile = {
  // Enhanced fields with document data
  value_proposition: profile.value_proposition || extractedInsights.valuePropositions?.join('. '),
  competitive_advantages: profile.competitive_advantages || extractedInsights.competitiveAdvantages?.join('. '),
  
  // Document-specific fields
  ai_extracted_insights: extractedInsights,
  document_derived_terminology: extractedInsights.industryTerminology,
  extracted_products_services: extractedInsights.productsServices,
  extracted_target_customers: extractedInsights.customerSegments
};
```

### **3. Agent-Specific Customization**

Each agent receives tailored prompts based on their function:

- **Falcon (Lead Generation)**: Focus on prospect identification and qualification criteria
- **Sage (Research)**: Emphasis on industry analysis and competitive intelligence  
- **Sentinel (Email)**: Communication style and response templates
- **Prism (Orchestrator)**: Request routing and workflow coordination
